# Cyclistic Data Analysis and Insights

## Overview
This repository contains the SQL queries and R Markdown (RMD) file used for analyzing Cyclistic's bike-sharing data. The analysis aims to identify strategies to convert casual riders into members by understanding their behavior and preferences.

## Repository Structure
- **SQL Queries**: This folder contains the SQL scripts used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis.
- **R Markdown**: The RMD file compiles the R scripts used to conduct detailed analysis, including data visualization and statistical significance testing.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries in this repository are used to:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, standardize schema, and prepare the dataset.
2. **Unionize Data**: Combine monthly data into a single table for comprehensive analysis.
3. **EDA and Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
4. **Statistical Testing**: Conduct statistical tests to understand differences between casual and member riders.

Each query is documented with its purpose and usage in the analysis. 

## R Markdown
The R Markdown file (`Cyclistic_Analysis.Rmd`) includes:
- **Data Loading and Preparation**: Scripts to load, clean, and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to illustrate key findings.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tests to determine the significance of differences in rider behavior.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, actionable strategies for converting casual riders to members.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Run SQL Queries**: Use a SQL editor like BigQuery to run the queries provided in the repository.
3. **Run R Markdown**: Open the RMD file in RStudio and execute the chunks to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Further Information
- **Project Goals**: Understand rider behavior to convert casual riders into members.
- **Next Steps**: Collect additional data, survey users, and refine strategies based on new insights.

## References
- **Data Source**: The data used in this analysis is publicly available from [data source link].
- **R Packages**: The R scripts use packages like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `data.table`.
